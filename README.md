# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

Starting this project I was very prepared to create something from scratch. I think it is amazing that we can pull information constantly off of the web in real time. Using an *Ajax* call is a foreign thing to me but after this I understand it very well. Starting off with a wireframe I mapped out my project in the *HTML* and went to work on the *JavaScript*. I am starting to learn a pattern on how to lay everything out and how to use local storage effectively and with ease. Finishing this up with styling I used *Bootstrap* and my own custom *CSS*.
